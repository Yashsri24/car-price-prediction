This project focuses on building a Car Price Prediction Model using Machine Learning techniques. The dataset includes various attributes of cars such as year of manufacture, selling price, fuel type, seller type, and transmission type, which help in determining the expected selling price. The project begins with data preprocessing, where unnecessary columns like Car_Name are removed, and new features such as Car_Age are created. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand data distribution, check for missing values, and visualize key trends in selling price.

The dataset is then split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, and a Random Forest Regressor model is trained to predict car prices. The model's performance is evaluated using key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score, indicating that the model achieves good predictive accuracy. Additionally, a feature importance analysis highlights which factors significantly influence car prices, such as Car Age, Fuel Type, Transmission, and Seller Type.

To make the model reusable, it is saved using pickle, allowing future predictions without retraining. This model can be useful for car buyers, sellers, and dealerships to estimate fair market prices based on relevant features.
